## Used Design Patterns

**Repository Pattern**
Abstracts data access logic to separate data persistence concerns from business logic.

**Unit of Work Pattern**
Handles transactions across multiple repositories to ensure data consistency.

**Dependency Injection (DI)**
Promotes loose coupling and enhances testability by injecting services where needed.

Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Organizes application logic into models, views, and controllers to promote separation of concerns.

## Architecture Patterns
TechXpress follows the **Three-Tier Architecture** pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability:

### 1. Presentation Layer (techXpress.UI)

- **Tech Used:** ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Handles user interaction and UI rendering.  
  - Sends requests to the Business Logic Layer.  
  - Displays data received from the Business Logic Layer.  

### 2. Business Logic Layer (techXpress.Services)

- **Tech Used:** ASP.NET Core Services  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Contains core application logic and business rules.  
  - Processes data from the Presentation Layer before passing it to the Data Layer.  
  - Validates input, manages workflows, handles calculations, etc.  

### 3. Data Access Layer (techXpress.DataAccess)

- **Tech Used:** Entity Framework Core  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Communicates with the database.  
  - Performs CRUD operations.  
  - Maps database entities to domain models.
